Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock

Technologies Used

HTML: Used to structure the webpage.
CSS: Used to style the webpage.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and game logic.

How It Works

The game is designed to be simple and straightforward:
The HTML part defines the structure of the page (buttons, result area, and images).
The CSS part handles the styling (centered text, styled buttons, etc.).
The JavaScript part contains the logic of the game:
When the player clicks a button, the playGame function is called.
The computer randomly picks a choice.
The game compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner.
The result is then displayed on the screen, along with corresponding images.

Example Walkthrough

Player chooses "Rock".
Computer randomly chooses "Scissors".
